## Description

In this project, it was requested to use the centrality algorithms in the graph theory to find the main character from a book, series or movie. We tried to find the main character among the characters of the book 'Me Before You' by Jojo Moyes. When we read the book, we saw that the main character was 'Louisa Clark'. So, our aim was to see that Louisa Clark was the main character as a result of centrality algorithms. Table below shows the relationship between the 10 characters in the book.

Also, all calculation function for centarality measures has been written dynamically. Graph can be constructed on demand subject and can be calculated centrality measures of that. Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Eccentricity Centrality, Betweeness Centrality and Eigen Centrality are available.
